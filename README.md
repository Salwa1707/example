<h1 style=>One Book Can Change a Life</h1>


<h2 style=>“What studies tell us is that the single most important skill you can teach a child is to read...” <br>This quote will reign true for all of time (Cantarella). Reading opens new possibilities, new mind-sets, and can change the heart. Although books can change the heart negatively, the positive change of heart that can come from books overshadows the negative. The places visited while reading are places that people can only imagine. Books can unintentionally capture the soul and captivate one’s mind. Books can change the way people think, which can lead to a change in the entire world.  The fact of the matter is, books can change a person’s life.</h2>

<h3 style=><em>"The more that you read,<br>the more things you will know.<br>The more that you learn,<br>the more places you'll go."<em></h3>
